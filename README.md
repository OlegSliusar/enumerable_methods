# Enumerable Methods

Ruby's Enumerable module gets mixed in to the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides us with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there's no magic to it, we're going to add new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy for us because any class or module can be added to.

This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks?ref=lc-pb) for more information. A test suite is also included with a [later project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-ruby) in the Ruby Track to test the program with RSpec.
